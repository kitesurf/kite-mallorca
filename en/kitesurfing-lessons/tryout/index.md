<h3>Tryout kitesurfing course (English)</h3>
<br>
 
ONLY â‚¬100.00 for 3 Hours<br>
<br><br>
<span>You always wanted to learn kitesurfing, but you are still unsure if this sport is for you, then our trial course is just the right choice.
It allows you to try out in one day what it feels like to fly a real kitesurfing kite and to make it pull you through the water.
You will learn the basics of flying a kite and gaining control over it, so that at the end of the course you will be able to hiss like a fish through the water and thus feel the fascination of kitesurfing on your own body.<br><br>

In terms of content, this trial course is the same as the first 3 hours of our full beginners course in kitesurfing, to which you can easily upgrade at anytime.
