<noscript><h3>Hydrofoil course in kitesurfing</h3>
 
<strong>200 € per person - mínimo 2 hs</strong><br><br>
<span>Hydrofoil, the new trend in kiteboarding has also arrived to us. Daniel was the first to bring "foiling" to our area about 3 years ago, and it was immediately very well received by many; more now that it's about to become an Olympic sport.<br>
Due to the perfect conditions for foiling in our bay, such as the daily breeze that blows very constantly at noon, this spot is ideal for learning and practicing foiling.<br>
In our "Foiling" course we make it as easy as possible for you. That's why most people learn how to cruise within the first 2-4 hours. <br><br>

The course takes place, after a 15 minute preparation time on the beach, in the bay further out with boat escort, where we take you there and stay with you.</span>
