# Since 10 years your kite surfing school on Mallorca

KITE-MALLORCA is located in Sa Marina, the beach in the bay between Alcudia and Port de Pollenca in the northeast of the island.  

We offer lessons for all kite levels (beginners, refreshers and advanced riders).  

As an absolute beginner you normally need about 10 hours of lessons to control the kite, do the first water-start attempts and ride the first meters so that you can then go into rental and continue to practice on your own under our supervision.  

The lessons for refreshers or advanced riders fully depend on the individual level of the kiter. Regardless of whether keeping height, going upwind, basic turn, jibe or first jumps - the instructor follows your needs and brings you to the next kite level!  

## Why book a kite course with us ?
* **Long international experience in kiting, kitesurfing and kiteboarding**

## **You just need to bring a great mood, fun and the desire to learn!**  

## **Our courses for beginners comprise the following elements**  

### 1) Basics and kite control:  
At the beginning of a beginner's course you learn a good kite control with a small trainer kite. With the help of practical exercises the wind window, correct mounting of the kite equipment and the safety systems of modern kites are explained to you.  

### 2) Body drag:  
As soon as you can control the kite on land we go into the water! During the first sessions in the water you learn the body dragging, which is like kitesurfing without board, where you let yourself drag through the water with the kite.  

### 3) Water start:  
After the successful body drags you get the board onto your feet and you learn how to ride the first meters on the water.
