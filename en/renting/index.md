#####Booking
In order to make sure that you always get the apropriate kite we recommend to book in advance for a rental period of one week or more. Then the equipment will be reserved for you.

#####Liability for rented kites and boards
We recommend to effect an insurance covering accident, third party liability and damage to rented equipment prior to the rental, e.g. the Safety Tool from VDWS.

In case of damage of a rented kite or board the customer is liable for the repair through one of our qualified professionals. In addition to the repair costs 20% of the present value has to be paid for the loss of value. In case of total damage or loss the customer is liable for the full present value.

Rental of kites and/or boards is only possible on the spot the KITE-MALLORCA team is visiting the same day. Rented equipment must not be taken to other destinations without our knowledge and approval.
